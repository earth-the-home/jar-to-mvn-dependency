# Problem with maven install plugin
currently, we can install external jar into maven only one file at once which is manaul work.

# Advantage of jar-to-mvn-dependency
we can install all external jars within specified folder into maven at once.

# Steps to use
1. download jar from /target/jar-to-mvn-dependency-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
2. java -jar jar-to-mvn-dependency-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar pathToExternalJarsFolder
